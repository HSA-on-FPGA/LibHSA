# LibHSA

Version 1.0 of the LibHSA library. This version contains the source code
for the work presented in [1]. The HSA AQL packet processor currently runs
a specialized software for the image processing accelerator [2]. However,
this can be changed as needed. An updated, generic version will follow in
the next revision.
