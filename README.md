# LibHSA

Version 1.0 of the LibHSA library. This version contains the source code
for the work presented in [[1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11265-018-1382-7), 
[2](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8122108/)]. The HSA AQL packet processor currently runs
a specialized software for the image processing accelerator
[[3](https://github.com/HSA-on-FPGA/HSA-Accelerator)]. However,
this can be changed as needed. An updated, generic version will follow in
the next revision.
